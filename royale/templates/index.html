                <p class="card-text">Children need to develop a concept of life skills to go hand in hand with academic knowledge. This course is designed to help children understand who they are and why they and others, think and act the way they do.

                  Life skills have a major impact on a child’s overall performance. It’s a great benefit when children understand their personality styles and how to communicate with family members and other people.
                  
                  Self-Awareness will be strengthened through the use of the Children’s Profile.
                  
                  Beyond grades, children will be empowered to appreciate similarities and differences in one another.</p>

                  The teenage years can be a difficult time to navigate through both for the teens and their parents. At PDI we believe the narrative can be changed through life skills.

We teach Self Awareness, Emotional Intelligence, Everyday Leadership skills, Communication Skills, Career and general Personal Development skills.We use assessment tools to enhance the training.
                  
                  We have also worked with teenagers who face the challenge of drug addiction and lost focus in their academics as a result.
                  
                  TRM for Teens is a powerful program because all lasting beings in the mind.
