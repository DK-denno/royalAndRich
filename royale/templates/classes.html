              <h1><b>What we offer</b></h1>
              <p style="color: black;" >It is a school with a different goal from what we are used to in traditional classrooms. PDI is practical in its approach and offers no sit-in examinations; we believe that life itself is a classroom with its own exams that are ongoing until we transition from this planet. However, we write term papers but in the form of 5-year strategic plans. The plans are life goals that our students pursue over the years. In our 9 years of operation, we have had the joy of our Alumni sharing their accomplishments after completing our programs 5 years or later having achieved over 80% of their goals.

                We run programs from as early as children aged 9 years, teens, young adults, adults and senior citizens (retired).
                
                For the various age groups, the classes are experiential, discussion-based and everyone becomes a LIFElong learner. We need to question life, learn life principles from experts and also hear what God’s perspective is on the issues that all of us find ourselves in from time to time.
                
                Every student has to learn more about whose they are, who they are, why they are and how to bring out who and why with friends, family and the society. </p>

                  <p class="card-text">Children need to develop a concept of life skills to go hand in hand with academic knowledge. This course is designed to help children understand who they are and why they and others, think and act the way they do.

                    Life skills have a major impact on a child’s overall performance. It’s a great benefit when children understand their personality styles and how to communicate with family members and other people.
                    
                    Self-Awareness will be strengthened through the use of the Children’s Profile.
                    
                    Beyond grades, children will be empowered to appreciate similarities and differences in one another.</p>
