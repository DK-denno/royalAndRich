                  <p class="card-text">Children need to develop a concept of life skills to go hand in hand with academic knowledge. This course is designed to help children understand who they are and why they and others, think and act the way they do.

                    Life skills have a major impact on a child’s overall performance. It’s a great benefit when children understand their personality styles and how to communicate with family members and other people.
                    
                    Self-Awareness will be strengthened through the use of the Children’s Profile.
